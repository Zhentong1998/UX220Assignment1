Compared with my goals, the portfolio learning goals have more details and daily routines. Because my dreams are generally macroscopic, each plan needs an evaluation method to measure the completion and quality of the goal. Electronic Portfolio Student Perspective Instrument (EPSPI) is a generally recognized method of evaluating learning objectives, which has been fully practiced in school term evaluation and employee evaluation. From my understanding, the portfolio is the key to joining a big family, in which there are people engaged in related education and practitioners in the same industry. When you have a portfolio, you can operate according to requirements and learn from each other. In addition, the portfolio function can help you record the timeline of learning content, help you create a learning timeline, and facilitate users to review and evaluate their learning history. Users can use this kind of evaluation in every big goal, accepted and revised suggestions, or be regarded as a shortcut to get social permission.
